Oxford Dictionary Extension for Chrome

# Note

This extension only use for individual purpose.

# Install anyway

This Extension can't be used if you dont remove the header `X-Frame-Options` from HTTP response in the chrome. Cuz Oxford prevented you get their page inside an `iframe`. So i recommend you install additional extension `Requestly`(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/requestly-redirect-url-mo/mdnleldcmiljblolnjhpnblkcekpdkpa?hl=en) which allow you to modify HTTP Headers by rules per request.
